Hi, my name is Eduardo Jos√© Silveira, I'm 22 and I'm a brazilian developer, who already work and practice with a some different languages
I start with game development with c++ using Unit when I was 14, some years lately my brother show me ruby, that was when I finaly
discovered what programming realy was. Today with influence of my years in college, I've become a web developer, I must not be a exceptional
professional but you can be sure, anyone is more dedicated and persistent than me, I will try and learn until I 
reach my expectations!!! I like to be a realy smiling person, who like make everyone laught, but in parallel, I'm a realy serious and quiet
when I focus diving into writing code.
